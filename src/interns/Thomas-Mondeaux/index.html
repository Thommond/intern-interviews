          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>I am a student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology's computer software
             engineering program. I want to be a software engineer because of the logical aspect
             of the field while still giving the scope for creativity. Being a software engineer
             means that I can work in all types of industry and help people no matter their field.
             What makes me want to be a software engineer  is the factor of working together to solve
             problems or create somthing new such as a website, application or API. </p>

          <h2>Learning</h2>

          <p>I would like to learn during this internship the real world methods of continuous development,
             team work, and how we meet deadlines while still giving a quality product. I would like to pick up
             a new technology on my way since the world of development is always innovating, it is not bad to be
             innovating with the company. During the internship solidifying my knowledge while gaining insight into
             the industry is my personal goal.</p>
